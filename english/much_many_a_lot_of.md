# What’s the difference between much, many and a lot?

**Much**, **many**, and **a lot** are _quantifiers_ that all mean ‘a large amount of’. The main difference between these words is that we can use **much** with _uncountable nouns_, **many** with _plural countable nouns_, and **a lot** with _both types of nouns_. However, these words are often mixed up by English learners. Read the examples below to master the difference, then put your knowledge to the test in the free exercises.

## Much and Many
### In Negative Sentences and Questions

> We mostly use much and many in negative sentences and questions.

* We use much with uncountable nouns.

Examples:\
    How much money do you have?\
    Louis can’t speak much Spanish.

* We use many with countable plural nouns.

Examples:\
    How many children do they have?\
    Louis doesn’t know many Spanish words.

### In Positive Sentences

> We can use much and many in positive sentences after words like so, too, and as. (A lot is not possible after so, too, and as).

Examples:\
As usual she has made _too_ many cakes.\
Take _as_ much time as you need.\
We had _so_ much fun at the party.\
~~They had so a lot of fun in Spain~~.

Much and many can stand alone in positive sentences, but **only** in a formal style. Be careful! This is not typical in everyday English, and can sound strange in informal contexts.

Examples:\
Much has been said about ...\
Many politicians believe ... 

## A lot

_A lot_ and _lots of_ are the most flexible _quantifiers_ in English: we can use them in positive sentences with countable and uncountable nouns. They have the same meaning, but _a lot of_ is more common.

Examples:\
They have met _lots of_ people.\
They have _a lot of_ friends.\
I have _a lot of_ money.\
I have _a lot of_ time.

>Although it is possible to use a lot/lots of in negative sentences and questions, it is more common to use much and many.

Example:\
Do you know many people in your neighbourhood? ↔ Do you know lots of people in your neighbourhood?

### Other ways to say ‘a lot’

English has several different words and expressions that have the same meaning as a lot:

_Formal_:\
plenty, a great/considerable number, a large/fair amount, numerous, a great deal

_Informal_:\
loads, a pile/piles, stacks, tons, mountains, more … than you can poke a stick at
