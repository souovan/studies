# Speak or talk uses

The verbs _speak_ and _talk_ both generally mean 'say words', but there are some small differences in how they are used. _Speak_ is more formal than _talk_

```
                          | 1. the speaker does not know you very well
I need to *Speak* to you  | 2. this is in a formal setting, such as work
                          | 3. what the person has to say is important/serious

                          | 1. the speaker is your friend
I need to *talk* to you   | 2. the speaker is someone you don't know very well, but what they have to say is informal

```

## Typical errors

* We don't use _talk_ when referring to foreign languages:

> I can *speak* German and Spanish
>
> Not: ~~I can talk German and Spanish~~

* We don't use _speak_ to focus on conversation:

> They can *talk* and get to know each other over dinner
>
> Not: ~~They can speak and get to know each other~~
