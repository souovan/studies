The **present perfect** is formed the *present tense* of the verb **have** and the *past participle* of a verb.

| I | have = 've |
| --- | ---|
| You | have = 've |
| He | has = 's |
| She | has = 's |
| It | has = 's |
| We | have = 've |
| They | have = 've |

We use the *present perfect* 

* for something that **started in the past** and **continues in the present**:

> They**'ve been married** for nearly fifty years.
> She **has lived** in Liverpool all her life.

* when we are talking about our **experience up to the present**:

> I**'ve seen** that film before.
> I**'ve played** the guitar ever since i was a teenager.
> He **has written** three books and he is working on another one.

We often use the adverb **ever** to talk about experience up to the present:

> My last birthday was the worst day i **have ever had**.

and we use **never** for the **negative form**:

> **Have** you **ever met** George ?
> Yes, but i**'ve never met** his wife.
