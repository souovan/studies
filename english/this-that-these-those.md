Use *this* to talk about **singular object** that is **close** to you:

> This cat is happy.

Use *these* to talk about **plural objects** that are **close** to you:

> These cats are happy.

Use *that* to talk about a **singular object** that is **far** from you:

> That cat is sad.

Use *those* to talk about a **plural objects** that are **far** from you:

> Those cats are sad.

**Hint**: These words function similarly to **here** and **there**.
